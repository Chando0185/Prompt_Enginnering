            "A: The city's most famous landmark is undoubtedly the Eiffel Tower, also known as the Iron Lady. It's a magnificent structure that stands at an impressive 324 meters (1,063 feet) tall and was built for the 1889 World's Fair, held in Paris to commemorate the 100th anniversary of the French Revolution. The Eiffel Tower was designed by Gustave Eiffel and his engineering company, and it took approximately 2 years and 2 months to complete, with a workforce of around 300 laborers. The tower is made up of over 18,000 pieces of wrought iron and weighs a total of around 7,300 tons. It's not only an iconic symbol of Paris and France but also a remarkable feat of engineering and a popular tourist destination, attracting millions of visitors each year. In fact, it's estimated that over 250 million people have visited the Eiffel Tower since its construction, making it one of the most-visited paid monuments in the world.
